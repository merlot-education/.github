## Setup development environment

### VM Setup
To provide a unified developer expierience we are working with a dedicated MERLOT developer VM and all documentation is refering to this machine.

[Developer VM Docs](Docs/DeveloperVM.md)

Even if we work with Ubuntu, it should work with Windows or MacOS, as well as other Linux distributions.

### Setup locally
All steps to setup the project locally are explained [here](Docs/SetupLocal.md)
